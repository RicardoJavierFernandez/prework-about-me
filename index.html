      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I work for an investment company, and have been in the 
        industry full-time for over six years. Programming has 
        quickly become a passion of mine which I hope to further 
        develop.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Hawaii for most of my life, and have
        lived in Florida for the past four years.
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love playing the guitar and piano. I'm also a huge
        boxing fan, having boxed on and off since my teens. I enjoy
        investing in the stock market and the debt markets.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'd like to own my own company one day, so being an 
        entrepreneur would be a dream job.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Miramar, FL</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've been programming on my own for 1.5 year now, and
        the more I program and learn, the more I want to keep doing it
        for a living. Web development would allow me to expand my
        knowledge and abilities as my goal is to develop web applications
        for a living.
